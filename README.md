## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a collection of basic data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. It is intended for educational purposes and to help individuals understand and implement fundamental concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data_structures/`**: Contains implementations of various data structures.
  - **`linked_list/`**: Singly linked list implementations.
  - **`doubly_linked_list/`**: Doubly linked list implementations.
  - **`stack/`**: Stack data structure implementation.
  - **`queue/`**: Queue data structure implementation.
  - **`binary_tree/`**: Binary tree implementations.
  - **`hash_table/`**: Hash table implementations.

- **`algorithms/`**: Contains implementations of fundamental algorithms.
  - **`sorting/`**: Sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
  - **`searching/`**: Searching algorithms such as binary search and linear search.
  - **`graph/`**: Graph algorithms including breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

Each subdirectory contains:
- **`.cpp` files** for implementations.
- **`tests/`** subdirectory for unit tests.
